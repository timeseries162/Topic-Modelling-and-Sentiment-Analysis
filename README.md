# Topic-Modelling-and-Sentiment-Analysis
 Text processing is a valuable tool to be able to provide crucial insights for businesses, governments and the public. Whether it be reviews, news headlines or social media posts, these sources contain vital information that when analysed with the proper tools can provide crucial insights. The goal of this project is to apply a Bayesian perspective to text analysis. The project is divided into two parts, the first part focuses on topic modelling, which divides the data into unobserved groups. The second part of the project relates to sentiment analysis, which uses natural language processing to estimate the polarity of text. We apply our algorithms to real world data and then discuss their efficacy.
